Kerrich:   OK. Tell me what the law of averages says.

Assistant: Well, suppose you're tossing a coin. If you get a lot of heads,
           then tails start coming up. Or if you get too many tails, the
           chance for heads goes up. In the long run, the number of heads
           and the number of tails even out.

Kerrich:   It's not true. ... First of all, with a fair coin the chance for
           heads stays at 50%, no matter what happens. ...

Assistant: I don't believe it. ... What are you going to tell the king?

Kerrich:   Well, I tossed the coin 10,000 times, and I got about 5,000 heads.
           The exact number was 5,067, the difference of 67 is less than 1%
           of the number of tosses.

Assistant: Yes, but 67 is a lot of heads. The king won't be impressed, if
           that's the best the law of averages can do.

Kerrich:   What do you suggest?

Assistant: Toss the coin another 10,000 times. With 20,000 tosses, the number
           of heads should be quite a bit closer to the expected number.
           After all, eventually the number of heads and the number of tails
           have to even out, right?

Kerrich:   You said that before, and it's wrong. ... In 1,000 tosses, the
           difference between the number of heads and the expected number was
           2. With 2,000 tosses, the difference went up to 13. ...

Assistant: So what's the law of averages?

Kerrich:   With a large number of tosses, the size of the difference between
           the number of heads and the expected number is likely to be quite
           large in absolute terms. But compared to the number of tosses,
           the difference is likely to be quite small.
